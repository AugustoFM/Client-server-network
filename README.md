# SIMPLE CLIENT/SERVER NETWORK - Group Project  DRAFT For completion and suggestions


## NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF YOUR PROJECT
This project was developed by Karina, Alice and Flaviano as a deliverable for the CSCK541 Software Development in Practice October 2022B class that is a requirement to complete a MSc. in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence by the University of Liverpool. 
A simple client/server network had to be implemented, and once it was done it has to be able to perform the a series of task detailled in the USAGE section below.


## DATA
This project can be runned with at set of file or dictionary that complies with the implemented format 

## INSTALL 
Recommendations for intalling the client/server. 

## USAGE
This basic client/server network allows the following usage:
a. Create a dictionary, populate it, serialize it and send it to a server

## RUNNING UNIT TESTS
The proposed unit tests checks the following functionalities:
1. Creation of a dictionary, populate it, serialize and send it to a server
2. It test the following pickling format: binary, JSON and XML
3. Creation of a text file and send it to the server
4. The encrypt function is tested showing the message, the encrypted message and the orinal message once disencyptted
