A capital city is an area of a country, province, region or state that is regarded as having primary status above any other city.

A de facto capital is a city that is head of a country's government or judicious system, but not the official capital city, possibly due to tradition, convenience, emergency or political problems.

A purpose built capital has been built because it's previous capital may have become too overpopulated, it's location deemed it vulnerable to attack, it bordered an unfriendly neighbour or it's previous capital was established by an invading force of which the newly gained independent country chose to change.

A split capital  is one that has been split either politically or geographically, having two or more separate regions.
